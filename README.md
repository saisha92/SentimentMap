# SentimentMap

The Project collects a stream of tweets from Twitter and analyses the tweet (Positive or Negative or Neutral tweet) using Alchemy API
Amazon SNS and SQS services are used to process the tweets that are coming in from twitter. Then the result is mapped onto a heat map
according to the location from where the tweet came from and also the mood of the person.
